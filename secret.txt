This file contains some test secrets for scanning.

This line is safe and contains no secrets.

Here is a fake AWS Access Key ID: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
And a fake AWS Secret Access Key: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY

This line is also safe.

The project's GitHub token might be ghp_a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6q7r8s9t0 and should be flagged.

Empty line above, empty line below.

Another safe line.

Sometimes keys are in quotes, like this API_KEY = "3a5b7c9d1f3g5h7j9k1l3m5n7p9r1t3v".

This should not trigger anything: AKEYLESS_API_KEY = "SAFE"

And finally, a private key:
-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----

-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----

End of file.
